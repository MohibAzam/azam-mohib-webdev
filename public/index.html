                Hi there! My name is Mohib Azam, and I am a rising third-year at Northeastern University, majoring in Computer
                Engineering and Computer Science.  This website is meant to serve as a hub for the work I produce in my
                Web Development class, CS4550. Prior to this class, I hadn't completed any personal projects,
                and I lacked (and still do) any real work experience. However, thanks to this class, I've been able to
                develop my knowledge and understand within the realm of Web Development, which certainly should help me
                in advancing myself to complete a project on my own!
            </p>

            <p>
                To navigate the website and see the work I have done, please use the tabs seen above.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you're interested in my resume, you can download it <a href="../extra/Mohib_Azam_Resume.pdf">here</a>
                (If you can't download it, it's likely due to browser compatibility...)
