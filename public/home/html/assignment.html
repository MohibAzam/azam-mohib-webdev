            <p>
                To aid us in understanding Web Development, our homework assignments revolved around incrementally
                working on a Web Application that would allow users to build their own websites without necessarily
                needing to code. I felt this was a rather solid way to help familiarize myself with the various
                concepts presented in class, and the context of a web application made the relationships between objects,
                as well as the necessary Services, APIs, and Models, easy to spot and understand. I found myself
                frequently referring back to this work when trying to develop my final project.
            </p>

            <p>
                I felt my resulting application worked rather solidly. It could performmost of the tasks that were
                designated by the assignment, be it setting up websites, the pages in the website, and the "widgets" of each
                page (that is, the replacements for traditional HTML elements). I also found it very easy to implement security
                in the website through encrypting passwords and session tracking. Of course, there was also the fact that
                this was implemented as a single-page application, allowing for a tight strcuture in my design with the
                HTML views, their controllers, the models housing all of the data, and the Client- and Server-side services
                to connect them all together.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of improvements I could've made, I felt there may have been some issues when it came to managing
                relationships among objects.
                In addition, I had some issues in fully implemented the JQuery elements needed to complete the assignments
                and, as a result of my clear unfamiliarity and a lack of time to fix that, this unfortunately resulted in me
                avoiding the use of JQuery for my final project. In all other respects, however, I felt my implementation
                was largely a success, and it certainly helped pave the way to my final project.

                    Due to issues in hosting both the Assignment and Project simultaneously, the Assignment application may not
                    function as intended on this hosted instance (at the very least, this is the case with the Assignment 6 iteration,
                    which is the final one). This problem will be addressed when possible. In the meantime, the github
                    repository linked contains multiple tagged releases for the progress I made on the application throughout
                    each assignment/iteration. Downloading the files and then running it in NodeJs using
                </p>
                <div class="well">node server.js</div>
                <p>
                    should result in the ability to view the assignment as it was intended.
