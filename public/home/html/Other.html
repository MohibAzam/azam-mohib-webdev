                        My very first coding project made at a summer camp! At the time, I was only familiar with the bare
                        basics of coding and wasn't really sure how I could apply it to making a tangible program. This
                        all changed, where I realized how much easier it was to understand the basic aspects of prgramming
                        when it was taught in the context of a game. So, I ultimately found myself developing
                        a small role-playing game that could be played solely through console outputs, utilizing
                        basic classes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal of the game is to collect swords and proceed up a tower. The game starts by allowing
                        the player to pick from a few different swords to start with. After this, the player begins
                        by battling the first monster. Much like standard RPGs, the player and the monster each have
                        Attack, Defense, and HP stats. They take
                        turns attacking one another until one of them reached 0 HP. Players have a basic attack they can
                        use, as well as a special attack for each sword that they have collected, which each have
                        their own unique effects, ranging from hitting multiple times, to modifying the player or
                        monster's stats, to dealing increased damage at the cost of the player's HP. If the player ever
                        dies, the game ends, but if the monster dies, the player levels up, increasing their stats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After battle, there is a random chance that the enemy will give the player a new sword to use,
                        and then the next battle commences. The stats of the monsters scale with the player's own level.
                        There are several different types of monsters with various stat differences that the player
                        can randomly encounter. Once the player has finally obtained all the swords, they move on
                        to fight the final monster of the game, who has much higher base stats compared to all of the
                        other monsters (its final stats are also improved based on the player's level ups). Beating
                        this monster then wins the player the game.

                        For my first true Computer Science class, we used a Lisp-related language to program a miniature version
                        of the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_(video_game)">Centipede</a>. Our version
                        largely removes most of objects from the game in an effort to keep things more simple and focused
                        (mushrooms, the centipedes, and the player where all that were involved). While it certainly was a struggle
                        trying to get it all to work, it eventually panned out and we were successful in roughly recreating the game,
                        as well as adding features such as a basic scoring system and vertical movement.

                        As a bit of a side hobby, I do proofreading for articles on a gaming-related site. I eventually
                        realized, however, that a lot of the changes that our editing team needed to do were very
                        simple changes. As a result, I realized that I could potentially create an application that could
                        automatically make the desired changes. And so, the idea of AutoGP was born.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The premise is simple: place some text within the leftside textbox, then press the button.
                        The application will automatically mark up some corrections that need to be made, doing so
                        by outputting the original text with BBCode (a markup language used by forums that we use
                        for our proofreading) in the areas where changes need to be made.
                        Currently, the application is only tuned to detect a few terms that have been hardcoded
                        into the Javascript file itself. Try inputting "my luke is fast." to see what a potential output.

                        Keep in mind that, at the time of starting this project, I was unfamiliar with both Git and
                        Web Development as a whole. As a result, my means of version control and overall programming
                        methodology were questionable to say the least. I would be interested in revisiting this project,
                        however, if I do, I'd like to start it over from scratch and utilize and web framework instead
                        to allow for a tighter system. In particular, I would use a Mongo Database to store the
                        list of changes that I would want to make to a body of text.
