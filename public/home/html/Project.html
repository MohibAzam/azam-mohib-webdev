            <p>
                The idea of this project really comes from a website called backloggery.com. Much like this application,
                backloggery allowed users to manage their game libraries through storing them in their own list and
                managing the progress they've made on them individually. Overall, it is a very solid and polished
                website. However, in terms of basic design, the site has some areas that could use some improvement.
                Perhaps the biggest of all is the fact that, despite revolving around managing game libraries, the website
                lacks an actual database or API to get game data from: All games that are going into your collection
                must be inputted manually. This also prevents you from being able to learn more about the game
                or socialize about it from within the website itself (unlike websites like GameFAQs). In fact, the website
                was overall rather lacking in terms of the ability to allow users to socialize with one another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, I decided that my project, MioDB (named after Mio Library, a location from one of my childhood
                video games), would improve on this regard, by implementing an API to allow users to get game data
                more automatically, make the website more mobile friendly, and allow for improved social interactions
                among users. While I'm not fully satisfied enough with the project to say I'd be willing to launch it,
                it certainly accomplishes the basic tasks I wanted it to do. It features a well-structed MEAN stack
                with Passport for improved security and session handling. Users can login and register through the
                website or by using their Facebook account, in which case the application will set up certain
                aspects of the user automatically.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once logged in, users can search for games and see more detailed info about them. On these detail
                pages, they can write comments or add them to their wishlists or gamelists. These two lists can be
                viewed from a user's profile. A wishlist is a simple list of just games that the user wants,
                sort of like bookmarking pages in a browser. The gamelist, however, it meant to represent a user's
                own collection of games. From the gamelist, the user can edit the games on it to mark the progress
                that they have made on the games, whether or not they're playing the game write now, any notes
                they have to say about the game, amongst other things. These changes are then viewable from the gamelist.
                Each user's profile also has a comment section that they or other users can post. Other users can be
                followed, giving an easy list of users to access, and their wishlist and gamelists can also be viewed.

                In terms of room for improvement, I feel the styling could've used some work. I mentioned in my github
                wiki that I was rather strapped for time when working on this project, and I feel like the overall
                styling was the weak point. It certainly gives off a clean look, thanks to being inspired by the designs of
                several web apps I frequently use (namely Speedrun.com, the mobile apps for Facebook and Twitter, and any
                forum that uses Xenforo). However, I feel it doesn't give off enough of a unique or eye-catching vibe,
                but that's just my personal opinion. I also feel like I could've tightened the relationships between
                objects or even expanded upon the data shown in the game pages. Overall though, I'm still happy with
                what I've produced. I wouldn't be opposed to launching it on my own at some point, seeing as I'm not
                really aware of any other site that does something similar...
