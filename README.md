# Mohib's Web Development Repository

Hi there! My name is Mohib Azam, and I am a rising third-year at Northeastern University, majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I have worked on various other projects for classes, such as a Centipede clone for my introductory CS class and a survey/data collection system for Software Developement. Unfortunately, I lack any true work experience and I have yet to complete a meaningful personal project, though I have been working on one on an anonymous account! (and I hope to use the skills I gain in this class to improve it)

I'll be using this repository to store some of the work that I do for my Web Development class, namely the assignments and in-class coding. I have already started making folders for the material we work on in class, and because it seems directly related to the assignments, I feel it would be helpful to  continue to add any such information here. Naturally, since the originally codebase that this project is cloned from was meant to be a template for our assignment work, any work I do for the assignments will be done here. However, because the project will probably have some notable differences from the assignment work, and because I wish to keep that work separate for organization purposes, the code for the project will be placed in a separate repository.

The Project Repository can be found here: https://github.com/MohibAzam/azam-mohib-webdev-project

The only other thing that I feel needs to be noted is that I am also a gigantic nerd.
