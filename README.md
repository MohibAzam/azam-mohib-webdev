# Mohib's Web Development Repository

Hi there! My name is Mohib Azam, and I am a rising third-year at Northeastern University, majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I have worked on various other projects for classes, such as a Centipede clone for my introductory CS class and a survey/data collection system for Software Developement. Unfortunately, I lack any true work experience and I have yet to complete a meaningful personal project, though I have been working on one on an anonymous account! (and I hope to use the skills I gain in this class to improve it)

I'll be using this repository to store the work that I do for assignments and in class. I have already started making folders for the material we work on in class, and because it seems directly related to the assignments, I feel it would be helpful to add any such information here, on top of the work done for assignments. However, because the project will probably have some notable differences from the assignment work, and because I wish to keep that work separate for organization purposes, the code for the project will be placed in a separate repository.

The Project Repository can be found here: https://github.com/MohibAzam/azam-mohib-webdev-project

The only other thing that I feel needs to be noted is that I am also a gigantic nerd.
