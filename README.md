# Mohib's Web Development Repository

Hi there! My name is Mohib Azam, and I am a rising third-year at Northeastern University, majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I have worked on various other projects for classes, such as a Centipede clone for my introductory CS class and a survey/data collection system for Software Developement. Unfortunately, I lack any true work experience and I have yet to complete a meaningful personal project, though I have been working on one on an anonymous account! (and I hope to use the skills I gain in this class to improve it)

I'll be using this repository to store some of the work that I do for my Web Development class, namely the assignments and in-class coding. I have already started making folders for the material we work on in class, and because it seems directly related to the assignments, I feel it would be helpful to  continue to add any such information here. Naturally, since the originally codebase that this project is cloned from was meant to be a template for our assignment work, any work I do for the assignments will be done here. I will also be working on a large-scale project for this class. For the time being, it will be placed within the Project folder for the sake of convenience (not needing to manage two repositories and Heroku instances). However, I do plan on hosting it on my own by the end of the semester to help differentiate it from the rest of the material in the Webpage.

The Heroku instance's Home Page can be found here: https://azam-mohib-webdev.herokuapp.com/

The only other thing that I feel needs to be noted is that I am also a gigantic nerd.
